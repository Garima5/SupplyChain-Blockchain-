<h3>
	Introduction:
</h3>
<p id="intro">
	This is a course project made as a part of EECE 571G [ Software Engineering in Blockchain ] course at UBC. We plan to implement a supply chain system using blockchain as backend and reactjs for component based ui system. The system would be open for the Distributer, Retailer, Producer to see the information of any product that the relevant party might have dealt with. For a Vendor making products , For Example a Mobile maker, they can track the components , their price , their inventory, and who made the component of the product if they chose to offload it.
</p>
<p>
	Similarly, for distributers and retailers, they can directly see the parties involved in supply chain. The project will also focus on ownership transfer and profit distribution among the vendor , retailer and distributer.
